<h3>Due Date</h3>
February 15, 2014, 11:59AM (just before noon).

<h3>24 Hour Silence Policy</h3>
Due to the large class size and the potential volume of questions, we are
implementing a 24-hour silence policy. This means that any questions posted on
the discussion forum in the 24 hours immediately preceding the assignment
deadline <b>may not</b> get answered in time. This does not mean that we will
stop answering questions the moment the day before the deadline arrives, it just means
that we cannot promise all the questions will be answered in time, due to our
prior engagements, such as other classes and meetings we have.
<p>
For this reason, please be sure to attempt the assignment early, and try to
complete it as if it were due two days prior to the real deadline.
<p>
In any case, we will try to answer all the questions that show up on the
discussion forum. Note that questions sent to emails will <b>not</b> be
answered, as we want all course related material to be viewed for everyone's
benefit.
<p>

<h3>What You Are Given</h3>
There are 2 questions in this assignment. The first question is to practice
polymorphism, and the second is on files.


<h3>Question 1 [21 points]</h3>
You are going to write a program that calculates the price of clothing with
the appropriate provincial tax. The store will manage clothing from British
Columbia, which has a PST of 7%,  and Manitoba, which as a PST of 8%.
Moreover, we will have two types of clothing: children and adult. Note that
children clothing does not get taxed in any province.
<p>

In this question, complete the following:
<ul>
  <li> <b>4 points</b>: 
  Define an abstract class called <tt>Clothing</tt> that contains information
  about the clothing's brand and price (before tax). 
  This class should have a constructor that initializes the attributes.
  This class should also have an abstract method called <tt>total()</tt> that
  returns the price of the clothing item after taxes have been applied.

  <li> <b>3 points</b>: 
  Define a class called <tt>Children</tt> that inherits from <tt>Clothing</tt>. 
  This class needs to have a constructor that initializes the brand and price.
  As well, this class will define the <tt>total()</tt> method.
  Finally, this class will define the <tt>toString()</tt> method to printing
  out all the attributes and final price after taxes of the item.

  <li> <b>4 points</b>: 
  Define a class called <tt>Adult</tt> that inherits from <tt>Clothing</tt>. 
  This class needs to have a constructor that initializes the brand and price.
  In addition, this class will define a constant <tt>GST</tt> at 0.05 to
  denote 5% of GST will be applied to the item. Then, the class will define
  the <tt>total()</tt> method which calculates the clothing price with GST
  (but not PST) on it.
  Finally, this class will define the <tt>toString()</tt> method to printing
  out all the attributes and final price after taxes of the item.

  <li> <b>5 points</b>: 
  Define a class called <tt>BCAdult</tt> that inherits from <tt>Adult</tt>. 
  This class needs to have a constructor that initializes the brand and price.
  In addition, this class will define a constant <tt>PST</tt> at 0.07 to
  denote 7% of PST will be applied to the item. Then, the class will define
  the <tt>total()</tt> method which calculates the clothing price with GST and
  PST on it. <b>Note:</b> You need to use the parent definition of
  <tt>total()</tt> for this part.
  Finally, this class will define the <tt>toString()</tt> method to printing
  out all the attributes and final price after both taxes of the item.
  <p>
  Define a class called <tt>MBAdult</tt> in the exact same way as you did for
  <tt>BCAdult</tt>. Follow the steps above. The only thing you should change
  is the class constant for MB tax, where the constant <tt>PST</tt> in this
  class is defined as 0.08 to denote 8% of PST.

  <li> <b>5 points</b>: 
  Define a test class called <tt>Purchases</tt> that creates a polymorphic
  array of five <tt>Clothing</tt> references.
  Initialize the array with a variety of clothing objects, but be sure to
  include at least one of: Children, BCAdult, and MBAdult.
  Write a loop to print out the items by calling each array item's
  <tt>toString()</tt> method (implicitly or explicitly).
</ul>

See <a href=a2q1-output.html>sample output</a> from the test class. 
Save your output into a file called <tt>Clothing-Output.txt</tt>.

<h3>Question 2 [13 points]</h3>
Write a simple HTML parser called <tt>TagParser</tt> that takes an input HTML
file, extracts all the words between the an opening and closing pair of "tt"
tags, and output those words (without the tags) into a plain text file.
<p>
An HTML file is a type of file used for websites. Unlike word, there is no
function like boldface or italicize. To specify when a word should be
displayed in a different way, tags are used. For example, to make a phrase
bold, you would type "< b >a bold phrase< / b >" where "b" stands for bold and the
angle brackets denote the tag. (There are no spaces inside the tags when you
use them, they are just here for clarity.) In order for a computer to
understand the difference between when it should start to bold and when it
should stop, an opening tag and a closing tag are used. The closing tag just
has an extra "/" in it. In this question, we will work with the HTML tag for
"teletype text" (tt for short).
<p>

In this question, complete the following:
<ul>
  <li> <b>3 points</b>: 
  In the <tt>TagParser</tt> class, define a constructor that reads from a
  file. You should download the file at: <br>
  <tt>https://people.ok.ubc.ca/bowenhui/121/a2.html</tt><br>
  and store it in your Eclipse project folder.
  Your program will read this file as input and extract information from it.
  In addition, your constructor will create a new file called
  <tt>a2-tagsOnly.txt</tt> which will store all the output later.
  Finally, your class will have a <tt>String</tt> array which will also be
  initialized in your constructor. You should initialize all your array
  elements to the following default string: "-1".

  <li> <b>4 points</b>: 
  Add a method called <tt>parseTT()</tt> that detects when a line has an
  opening tt tag. Recall various <tt>String</tt> methods you can use here.
  When you have such a line, find the index position where the opening tag
  ends and the index position where the closing tag starts so you can extract
  the words in between. Once you extract the words in between, store that
  substring into your <tt>String</tt> array. When you are done, your array
  will have 34 extracted phrases.

  <li> <b>4 points</b>: 
  Add a method called <tt>storeTT()</tt> that goes through each element in
  your <tt>String</tt> array via a loop and outputs it onto a separate line in
  the file you created earlier. Don't put any of the default values "-1" into
  the file.  Be sure to close your file when you are done, otherwise it will
  seem like you have not written anything to the file. 
  
  <li> <b>2 points</b>: 
  Create a test class that gives the a2.html file to a <tt>TagParser</tt>
  object. Call the two methods you've created to test your program. Be sure to
  check your <tt>a2-tagsOnly.txt</tt> file to see if it has the information you
  expect.
</ul>

See <a href=a2q2-output.html>sample file</a> from the test class. 
There is no output from this class.

<h3>What to Submit</h3>
Be sure to comment all the methods and attributes for clarity.

<li> Children.java
<li> Adult.java
<li> BCAdult.java
<li> MBAdult.java
<li> Clothing-Output.txt
<li> TagParser.java
<li> TestParser.java (or test class file you used)
